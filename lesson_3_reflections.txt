When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work

Both to keep changes in sync across computers (say home laptop and work desktop) and to collaborate with others.
You could pull, work on things, then push so collaborators can pick up where you left off (or work simultaneously).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Dropbox is that idea of meaningful changes get updated not all changes (if you are keeping track of commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

stored locally?
