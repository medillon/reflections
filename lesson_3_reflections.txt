When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Both to keep changes in sync across computers (say home laptop and work desktop) and to collaborate with others.
You could pull, work on things, then push so collaborators can pick up where you left off (or work simultaneously).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
